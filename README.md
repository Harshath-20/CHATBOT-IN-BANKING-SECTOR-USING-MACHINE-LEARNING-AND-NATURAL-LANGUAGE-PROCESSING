# 💬 Banking Chatbot using Machine Learning & NLP  

## 🔹 Overview  
This **Banking Chatbot** is a full-stack AI-powered system designed to handle banking-related queries using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and SQL**, it processes user queries by leveraging a dataset of **1,700+ Q&A pairs** to provide accurate responses. The chatbot features an **HTML-based front-end** and a Flask-powered back-end for seamless interaction. It automates customer support, reducing response time and improving efficiency. Key functionalities include **intent recognition, SQL-based data retrieval, and real-time response generation**. Future enhancements include expanding the dataset, deploying as a web service, and improving UI/UX for a better user experience. 🚀  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Machine Learning & NLP** – Uses Scikit-learn and NLP techniques to process user queries.  
✅ **Custom Dataset** – Trained on a **1,700+ banking queries dataset** for accurate responses.  
✅ **SQL Integration** – Efficient data handling and retrieval for better performance.  
✅ **Front-end UI** – Simple **HTML-based interface** for user interaction.  
✅ **Automated Query Resolution** – Reduces response time and improves customer experience.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Flask for back-end)  
- **NLP & ML** (Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy)  
- **SQL** (for storing and retrieving query responses)  
- **HTML/CSS** (for the chatbot interface)  

## 📌 How It Works  
1. **User enters a banking-related query** in the chatbot.  
2. **NLP model processes and understands** the question.  
3. **ML algorithm retrieves the best-matching response** from the dataset.  
4. **Response is displayed** to the user instantly.
